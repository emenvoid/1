before starting this repo, my fatal problem is overthinking and over-preparing for things, thus get nothing done or done it very later on.
it costs so much time and leads to failures, so i decide to stop this shity habit, start treating progress seriously.

currently, i choose GitHub as my "head center", using this repo to track all my progress.
- issues for thoughts and resources
- Zenhub for project management
- Toggle for time tracking
- Git for related file management

i am doing it publically since i think this is the future for people who want to change the world, everybody can view what everybody else is doing, and help each other to change.
- being public is more efficient than nobody knows what you doing, and no interactions/communications/collaborations.
- being private is only suitable for people with shady and selfish goals, that acctually sabotage the world.
